# My Portfolio
The goal of this Udacity project is to build a portfolio website. I have a design mockup as a PDF file and I have to replicate that design in HTML and CSS.

The page at minimum includes all of the following:

* at least 4 images
* title text (h1, h2, etc.)
* regular (paragraph) text
* a logo.

Provide at least one of the following customizations:

* Customize images and text.
* Customize placement of the elements on the page (grid layout) with HTML, CSS or both.
* Customize CSS styles applied at minimum to paragraph and heading elements.

All content is responsive and displays on all display sizes. This includes:

* Desktop
* Mobile: Google Nexus 5
* Tablet: Apple iPad
